# Phomemo D30 Web Bluetooth UI

A browser-based label designer and printer for the Phomemo D30 using only Web Bluetooth (no app required). This Repo is intended for personal use only, but others are free to use it should they benefit from it.

You can access the Web UI via this URL: [Phomemo D30 Printer Web UI](https://printer.spicylimes.com/)

## Features
- Pure HTML + JavaScript (works offline once loaded)
- No Native App means no Installation or Configuration
- Direct Printing via a Chrome-Based Browser's "Web Bluetooth" Protocol

## Support and Troubleshooting
I will **not**, have **not**, and do **not** provide any support for this Web UI as it is not my creation. Please see the "History" section below for the original Author's GitHub Repo to submit an Issue directly. 

## History
This Repo is a fork of [Benni306's](https://github.com/Benni306/phomemo-d30-web-bluetooth) and [narrowstacks'](https://github.com/narrowstacks/phomemo-d30-web-bluetooth) Extended Web UI for printing Labels via a Browser on the Phomemo D30 Label Printer. Their Repos were forked from the original creator of this Web UI which can be found [here](https://github.com/odensc/phomemo-d30-web-bluetooth).

## Key Differences

- Potential for creating a Docker-ized Version in the future.

## Update History
- 2025/12/01: After attemping to merge the best features from Benni306's and narrowstacks' Web UI (and failing), I decided to make a simple landing page that allows access to either UI depending on needs. I am hosting the landing page, and each of the creators Web UI repo files on my own server for ease of access personally (but can be used by anyone). If I can ever properly train a coding AI agent to properly merge these two UI's, I'll add it to this repo in the future.
