# Phomemo D30 Web Bluetooth UI

A browser-based label designer and printer for the Phomemo D30 using only Web Bluetooth (no app required). This Repo is intended for personal use only, but others are free to use it should they benefit from it.

You can access the Web UI via this URL: [Phomemo D30 Printer Web UI](https://printer.spicylimes.com/)

## Features
- Pure HTML + JavaScript (works offline once loaded)
- No Native App means no Installation or Configuration
- Direct Printing via a Chrome-Based Browser's "Web Bluetooth" Protocol

## Support and Troubleshooting
I will **not**, have **not**, and do **not** provide any support for this Web UI as it is not my creation. Please see the "History" section below for the original Author's GitHub Repo to submit an Issue directly.

This Repo is a fork of [Benni306's](https://github.com/Benni306/phomemo-d30-web-bluetooth) Extended Web UI for printing Labels via a Browser on the Phomemo D30 Label Printer. Their Repo was forked from the original creator of this Web UI which can be found [here](https://github.com/odensc/phomemo-d30-web-bluetooth).
