# Phomemo D30 Web Bluetooth

Proof of concept and demo of printing to a [Phomemo D30](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HV3MPFD) Bluetooth label maker via the browser using Web Bluetooth.

## Demo

[My extended demo version is available here.](https://Benni306.github.io/phomemo-d30-web-bluetooth/) Please use a Web Bluetooth-compatible browser (e.g. Chromium-based).

## Credits
This version is based on the [demo by odensc](https://odensc.github.io/phomemo-d30-web-bluetooth/)

Inspiration for the data structure / image conversion was taken from some other great open-source projects. Thanks to:
